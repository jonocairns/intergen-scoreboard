# Intergen Leaderboard

A simple scoreboard application with realtime updates. Initally designed for the Intergen booth at Ignite NZ. Users could sign up and play Halo, their score was reported and displayed on a leaderboard. Administrators could add/remove scores, text/email users who won things.

It's all built with angular/firebase (no backend). Using mandrill for txt/email.
